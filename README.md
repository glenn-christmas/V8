An R interface to Google's open source JavaScript engine. This 
package can now be compiled either with V8 version 6+ (LTS) from nodejs
or with the legacy 3.14/3.15 version of V8.

## Getting started

About the R package:

 - Vignette: [Introduction to V8 for R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/V8/vignettes/v8_intro.html)
 - Vignette: [Using NPM packages in V8 with browserify](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/V8/vignettes/npm.html)
 
To see some quick examples in R run:

```r
library(V8)
example(v8)
```

## Installation
 
Binary packages for __OS-X__ or __Windows__ can be installed directly from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("V8")
```

On Linux you need a suitable libv8 installation, see below.

### Linux: Static libv8

__NEW:__ As of V8 3.4 there is a new option for x64 Linux platforms to automatically download a suitable static build of libv8 during package installation. To use this, set an environment variable `DOWNLOAD_STATIC_LIBV8` during installation, for example:

```r
Sys.setenv(DOWNLOAD_STATIC_LIBV8 = 1)
install.packages("V8")
```

This way, you can install the R package on any x64 Linux system, without local system requirements. We enable this by default on CI and also on Linux distros that are known to have no suitable version of libv8 available. But for local installations, you need to opt-in via the env var above.

It is also still possible to install libv8 from your distribution as described below.


### Debian / Ubuntu 

Installation from source on Linux requires [`libv8`](https://v8.dev/). On Ubuntu / Debian you need to install either [libv8-dev](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libv8-dev), or [libnode-dev](https://packages.ubuntu.com/eoan/libnode-dev). On the latest systems, `libv8-dev` is actually an alias for `libnode-dev` so they are the same:

```sh
# Debian and Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install -y libv8-dev
```

### Backports for Xenial and Bionic

Ubuntu versions before 19.04 ship with a rather old V8 engine in libv8-dev. The R package can be compiled against this, but the engine only supports ES5, so some "modern" JavaScript syntax may not work. A lot of JS libraries these days require this.

A recent version of the V8 engine is available in `libnode-dev` from our the [cran/v8](https://launchpad.net/~cran/+archive/ubuntu/v8) PPA:

```sh
# Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) and Bionic (18.04) only
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cran/v8
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libnode-dev
```

After installing `libnode-dev` you need to reinstall the R package, and you should be good to go.

### Fedora / Redhat

On __Fedora__ we need [v8-devel](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/v8):

```sh
sudo yum install v8-devel
````

On __CentOS 7 / RHEL 7__ we install [v8-devel](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/v8-devel) via EPEL:

```sh
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install v8-devel
```

On __CentOS 8 / RHEL 8__, we can use the `node:16-epel` module repository:

```sh
yum --refresh --enablerepo=epel-testing-modular install @nodejs:16-epel/minimal v8-devel 
```

### Arch Linux

Arch users are advised to install the [`v8-r`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/v8-r/) package, which has been configured to work well with R. Installation can done through your preferred AUR helper such as yay, Trizen, etc. However, since V8 contains a large codebase and (re-)compilation takes a while, users may prefer to build and update it manually. For example,

```sh
## Arch
cd /tmp
yay -G v8-r   
cd v8-r
makepkg -si
```


### Homebrew

On __OS-X__ use [v8](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/v8) from Homebrew:

```sh
brew install v8
```

On other systems you might need to install libv8 from source.


## Hello World

```r
# Create a new context
library(V8)
ctx <- v8()

# Evaluate some code
ctx$eval("var foo = 123")
ctx$eval("var bar = 456")
ctx$eval("foo+bar")

# Assign / get objects
ctx$assign("foo", JS("function(x){return x*x}"))
ctx$assign("bar", JS("foo(9)"))
ctx$get("bar")
```

Call functions from JavaScript libraries

```r
ctx <- V8::v8()
ctx$source("https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/coffee-script/1.4.0/coffee-script.min.js")
jscode <- ctx$call("CoffeeScript.compile", "square = (x) -> x * x", list(bare = TRUE))
ctx$eval(jscode)
ctx$call("square", 9)
```
